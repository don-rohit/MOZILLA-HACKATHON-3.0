# MOZILLA HACKATHON 3.0
We propose an idea to create a child friendly Website that will be teaching children to code in such way that they won’t feel any overhead involved in the Coding. In Our Website the Children would be learning the basic concepts of Coding through playing Games without any prior knowledge. We will teaching them basics about looping, Control & Flow Statements, Loop Statements through some interacting games like a maze game .
 
## Objective
In the Age o Information Coding is one of the trendiest and most interesting field. 
Gone are the days when children dream only of becoming astronauts, pilots, military and doctor.
Coding as we all know is not Child friendly.
As mostly the editor consists of Black window with a set of instructions without any GUI.

## About The Game

The children will be learning to code[ basics of if else and while ] via a maze game. The maze game has certain levels, with every level the child learns a new concept on top of the previous one. The task is to move the man using three basic action functions [predefined], move forward, turn right and turn left and help him reach the destination.

## Learning elements
In higher levels[Level 1 – 10] kids will be learning about some complex functions like only-if , if-else and while loop.
Until : similar to the while statement repeats a certain task until the destination is reached 
If : condition check and move If its right.
If-else: condition check and do things if its right or not accordingly.
